Difference between React and Angular?

Parameters                           React                                     Angular
library/framework               -React is Library                       -Angular is a framework.
languages                       -js and XML                             -TypeScript.

What is react?
It is a js Library.
Used to create rich user interface
it create sigle page application(SPA).
Designed and Developed by Facebook.
latest version of React 18.


*software pre-requisit
-nodejs
-npm
-react
-editor

*technology must know
-html
-css
-js(basic js,es6,es5,oops)


*how to create react appliaction?
There are three ways-
1> By using npx: no need to install configuration file.
-npx create-reat-app reactprojectname
-cd reactproject.
-npm start

2> By using npm: need to install configuration file.
-npm install -g create-reat-app
-create-react-app reactprojectname
-cd reactproject.
-npm start

*Folder structure of react app
node modules:in this all dependencies and
 dev-dependencies will install in it.

 package.json:all intalled dependencies entry will found here.
 package-lock.json:it will contain detail info about installed dependencies.

 README.md:it is guide for react app.
 gitignore: it will containes names of files which are not going to upoad on git repo.

 public:it contain static files in it.


*react work on component basis.
*compoonent :it is partial partial part of react app.
-which can we reuse throught react app.
-it can be any part of react app.
Note:in react app.js is root component

*In react there are two types of components.
1:function component.(When your aim focus is on ui design we use function component)
2:class component.(when we have to implement and write complex logic in that case we use it. )


NOTE:WHILE CREATING COMPONENTS IN REACT ITS FIKE NAME START WITH CAPITAL LETTER.


*how to display component output oe view?
-to get output of any component for this first we have to import it and them write its name as tag where you want.

*class component.
how to create class component and get its output.
-create file with ext js .
-first import React from react.
-create class and extends it with Component class.
Other wise it will treated as simple class.
-that if we have to return something from it use render method render(){

}

element
*what is JSX
-JSX(javascript and XML);
-it makes react code easy and allows us to write html code in react.
-in jsx we have to put all  inside one parent element. in function
-the parent element must be block element.



*props:
-it is parameter or functional parameter which is use to pass data inside component.
-it returns object type of data.
-in function we can access props by writing props.prosName. it will access like={props.fname}
-in class coponent we can access props by writing this.props,propsName. it will access like{this.props.fname}

*what is state?
-it is use to handle essential data in class component.
-state always write inside class constructor.
-it returns object type of data.
-in class component we can access state property by wirting this.state.propertyName.

After React 16.
*we can use state in function component by using useState Hook.


*setState(): this method is use to manipulate update state property values in class component.



how to use css in react?
1.internal
2.inline
3.external
4.module css:
-it is use when we have to write css property for particular component.
-it will be applicable only when you import it.
- to create module css use filename.module.css


*how to use bootstrap in react?
step1.install bootstrap in project.
npm i bootstrap
import "/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";


*Conditional Rendering
-display component output on the basis if condition.
1.if else :in this if condition if true diplay block if false display another block.

2.element as a variable :in this we strore result in a varivale and that variable we return on the basis of condition.

3.use of ternary operator

4.short circuit(&&):it is use of null checking.and will display output only when condition is true.


*How to insert images and multimedia files in react project?
create a component.




*Component Interaction?
-Accessing data from parent component to child Component
-to perform this first we have inbetween component they must have parent child relation.

ParentComp(cc)
-create state having empname and salary and display it.
-implement logic so after click on button emplname ans salary must change.


*how to pass state property as props?


*PureComponent in React
-it is a component which is provided by react,which is used to prevent un-necessary re rendering of class component.,By comparing shallow comparision
-to achive this we extends component with pure component class.

*React.memo():
-it is a component which is provided by react,which is used to prevent un-necessary re rendering of function component.,By comparing shallow comparision
-to achive this we pass function component name as a argument to React.memo() method.

*Virtual Dom?
In React instead of manipulating browser DOM directly react creats virtual dom in its memory .
-where it does all the necesaary changes before performing in the real dom.
-Vitual dom chnages that need to be change only.
-that is why react is faster.


React.Fragment or Fragment:it is used to remove un-necessary Dom element from  heirarchy.

*react-Bootstrap: it will provide us inbuilt component which we use to make react app attractive and responsive.
step1:install it
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
Step 2:import its path in index.js file

MyCarousalComp(fc)
import Carousel from 'react-bootstrap/Carousel';
import Cards from 'react-bootstrap/Cards';

import {,cards} from 'react-bootstrap';

there must be bootstrap install in you project and imported in index.js


*use of snippet
rce:to create class component.
rconst:it will create constructor,super(),this.state.
rfce:it will create functional component.
rafce:it will create arrow functional component.
ClickCounterComp()


*Higher Order Component(HOC)
-when we have to share common business logic with multipe component.
-for HOC we write logic in functional component and share data from it.


*ErrorBoundary
-it is react component,which is use to handle error occured in component tree while renderin component.
-it handle error which occur at the time component render.
-to ahieve this we use two class component lifecycle method
-1>getDerivedStateFromError:this is static ,it will ecxecute automatically whn error occur in child component.
2>componentDidcatch:it will error long or error information.

UserComp(fc)

*Class Component lifecycle method:
-class component lifecycle method comes with four phases
1.Mounting Phase: when component get initialized.
    -constructor: it execute automatically when component initalize.
    -getDerivedStateFromProps: when you have to assign props value to state.
    -render:it is use to display component output.
    -componentDidMount: it will execute after render method.
2.Update Phase:
    -constructor
    -shouldComponentUpdate: it will decide whether componet will update or  not.
                            -it return boolean result.
                            -if value is true component will update other wise not.
    -getSnapShotBeforeupdate: it will return state or props value before updation of it.
    -render:it will display component output.
    -componentDidUpdate:
3.Unmounting Phase:component will delete or remove.
-componentWillUnmount:it will executebjust beforre component remove or delete,
it will disconnect all connection with other and server.

4.Error Phase: to handle error
-1>getDerivedStateFromError:this is static ,it will ecxecute automatically whn error occur in child component.
2>componentDidcatch:it will error long or error information.


*Hooks in react:
-it allows us to use class component feature in a function component.
-by using react hooks we an use state in funtion component.
-react hoos introduce in react version 16

*Rules to use hooks:
-Hooks will work only in function component.
-Hooks always in top level component.
-Hooks cannot be render conditionally.


*there are seven hooks in react.
1>useState Hook
2>useEffect Hook
3>useContext Hook
4>useRef Hook
5>usereducer Hook
6>useMemo Hook
7>useCallback Hook

*useState hook:
-it allows us to use state in function component.
-it return two values.1.currentState,2.method-of-update-current-state
-useState hook accept all type of data(number,string,boolean,array,object)
-before using it import it first.

*Routing in react?
-if you want to navigate from one component to another for that we use it.
-to perform routinh in react we have to install react-router-dom library in reat project.
 types of routing?
 1.naming routing:to dispaly component write component path in browser url to get output of it.

 2.default routing:when we have to dislay component output without writing its routing path name in browser url.

 3.parameteried routing:display component output only when we pass parameter with its routing path name,

 4.child routing:when we have to dispaly one routing inside another routing in that case we use it.
  -to perform child routing we user children object.
 -to display child component output in parent component for that we have add <Outlet/> directory in parent component.


 5.wild card routing:when user enter wrong routing path name in browser url in that we direct user to particular component in that case we use it.
 -for wild card routing in its path name we write * symbol.
 -impNote:wild card routing always write at ;ast,its below routing will never work.

 how to install react-router-dom library?
 npm i react-router-dom
 *react-router-dom library provide two directory
 1.createBrowserRouter:it is a method which states values as an array of objects
 -in this we create routing path for component.
 -to create route we use object having path element property.

 2.RouterProvider:it display component routing on browser.

 *use of Link directory
 
 src Folder
    mainRoutingFolder
        -routing.js(file)


 src Folder 
    layout Folder 
        LoginComp(fc)
        NavComp(fc)
        FooterComp(fc)
        MainDashBoardComp(fc)
        PageNotFoundComp(fc)


  *useEffect Hook:     
-it is use to perform side effect in function component.
-side effect means , fetching data from server, use of timer, Dom manipulation
-useEffect hook execute after function component render.
it will return two values:1>callback function,2>dependency
syntax:useEffect(()=>{},dependency)

case1:when we donot pass second parameter












src Folder
    CRUD Folder
        productDashComp(fc)
        AddproductComp(fc)
        EditProductComp(fc)

*Axios Library:
-it is use to make request from react app to server-it works on promisses concept
-how to install Axios
npm i axios


material Ui:
-it is use to make recat attractive and responsive.
-it provide inbuilt component.
-as well as it provide icon.
www.mui.com
how to install?
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

how to install matrial icon?
npm install @mui/icons-material

useNavigate hook
useParam hook

useRef hook: it is used to access DOM node directly.
            -it has a object with name current .

REact :it is use to create Rich Ui
    -it is js library.

Redux:it is a predictable state container for js app.
    or
    it is used to store,manage,and track state centrally for js app.
    it is not tied with react only.it can be used with app js app.
    how to install?
     npm i redux
    *redux work on three core principle
    Action: it is a statement (operarion) which we are going to perform.
    store:it is used to store state in it.
    Reducer:it actually carrryout state transition depeneding on action and store .
            -after performing operation it return new state.

    *how to access state and action from redux to react function component?
    -useSelector hook:it is used to access state from redux store to react function component.
    -useDispatch Hook:it is use to call action from redux to react function component.
   

react-redux library:to connect react app with redux library for that we use react-redux library.

*web Storage:it is use to store user data on browser.
1>local Storage:it is uswed to store user data fro permanent.
2:session storage:it is use to store user data for temporaray
